# TEST Reverse Proxy

Maybe I am just bad at searching, but for the life of me I could not find out how to use NGINX to make a HTTPS reverse proxy that sits in front of multiple HTTP application under different domains with a single Let Encypt certificate. SSL should be set up for the reverse proxy only for convenience. So as any good man would, I am making my own. And so far it turning out to be pretty straight forward.

If you know how to configure the  NGINX ( or any other web server software ) in the way I am looking for please enlighten me with a pull request your approach to solve my problem.
