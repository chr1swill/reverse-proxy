# TEST Reverse Proxy

Maybe I am just bad at searching for information but for the life of me I could not find out how to use NGINX to make a HTTPS reverse proxy that site in front of multiple HTTP application with a single Let Encypt certificate set up for the reverse proxy only. So like any good man would I am making my own, and so far it is turning out to be much simpler.

If you know how to create the reverse proxy I am looking for in NGINX ( or any other web server software ) please enlighten me with a pull request of the configuration.
